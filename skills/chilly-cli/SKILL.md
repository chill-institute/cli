description: Use `chilly` to operate chill.institute from the terminal. Start here for shared agent-safe defaults, then load the nested reference docs for auth, reads, mutations, or contract discovery only when that workflow is relevant.

# Chilly CLI

Use `chilly` as the local CLI entrypoint for chill.institute. For agent workflows, default to `--output json` and parse `stdout` only. When `stdout` is not a TTY, `chilly` now defaults to compact JSON unless `--output` is set explicitly.

Security posture: the agent is not a trusted operator. Prefer commands that validate locally, reject ambiguous or path-like opaque IDs, and preview mutations before side effects.

## Progressive Disclosure

- Load [auth.md](./references/auth.md) when the task is about login, logout, `whoami`, profiles, or host verification.
- Load [read.md](./references/read.md) for `search`, hosted reads, transfer reads, indexers, and folders.
- Load [mutate.md](./references/mutate.md) for side-effecting commands such as `add-transfer`, settings writes, download-folder changes, auth changes, and `self-update`
- Load [contracts.md](./references/contracts.md) for `schema`, `--describe`, `doctor`, and local contract discovery.
- Keep this root skill loaded when multiple chilly workflows are mixed in one task.

## Defaults

- Use the installed `chilly` binary directly.
- If `chilly` is not on `PATH`, stop and help the user install the CLI before continuing.
- Check `chilly settings get api-base-url --output json` before assuming which hosted environment is active.
- Use `--profile <name>` or `--config <path>` when you need isolated local state.
- For repo maintenance or local sanity checks, prefer `mise run smoke`, `mise run verify`, and `mise run coverage:report`
- Use `schema` or `--describe` when you need the current local contract before running a command.
- Use `doctor` when auth, config path, profile, or environment state looks inconsistent.
- Prefer top-level canonical commands like `search`, `whoami`, `list-top-movies`, and `add-transfer` over nested aliases.
- Use `--fields` when a read command supports it and you only need a stable subset of the payload.
- Use `--dry-run` on mutating commands when you need a safe preview.
- Prefer `--json @-` for larger mutating request bodies instead of shell-escaping long inline JSON strings.
- When reading `user indexers`, treat `status` as a tri-state contract: `healthy`, `degraded`, or `down`.
- Treat `stderr` as non-contract output. Prompts, progress, recovery hints, and browser-login notices may appear there.
- Omit `--output json` only when a human explicitly wants the built-in terminal summary.
- Prefer one narrow skill from the library above over pasting this whole file into a prompt when only one workflow is relevant.

## Output And Safety

- Prefer `--output json` for automation.
- Piped runs default to JSON automatically, but explicit `--output json` is still the safest choice when a workflow depends on the contract.
- Expect prompts, browser-login hints, and transient loading indicators on `stderr`; parse only `stdout`
- Expect failures in `--output json` mode to appear as a single JSON envelope on `stderr`
- Prefer top-level canonical commands when both top-level and `user ...` forms exist.
- Use `whoami` after auth changes when you need positive confirmation that the token works.
