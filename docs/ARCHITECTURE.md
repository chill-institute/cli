# Architecture

This document describes how `chill-institute-cli` is built.

## System Context

```mermaid

  User --> CLI["chilly"]
  CLI --> Config["local config store"]
  CLI --> RPC["HTTP RPC client"]
  RPC --> API["hosted API"]
```

## Components

| Component | Responsibility | Talks to |
|-----------|----------------|----------|
| Cobra command layer | Parse commands, flags, and output mode | app context, config store, RPC client |
| App context | Share config path, API URL, output mode, and helpers | commands, config store |
| Metadata registry | Describe public commands and linked backend procedures for agents | commands, schema surfaces |
| Config store | Persist local auth token and API base URL | filesystem |
| RPC client | Send JSON requests to v4 procedures, attach auth headers, map errors | hosted API |
| Build info | Carry version, commit, and build date into released binaries | version command, release flow |
| Release updater | Resolve GitHub releases and install matching binaries | self-update command |
| Output renderers | Render pretty or JSON command output | command handlers |

## Command Model

```mermaid
graph TD
  Root["chilly"] --> Auth["auth"]
  Root --> Completion["completion"]
  Root --> Schema["schema"]
  Root --> Doctor["doctor"]
  Root --> Whoami["whoami"]
  Root --> Settings["settings"]
  Root --> Search["search"]
  Root --> TopMovies["list-top-movies"]
  Root --> Transfer["add-transfer"]
  Root --> User["user"]
  Root --> Version["version"]
  Root --> SelfUpdate["self-update"]
```

Current command groups:

| Command | Responsibility |
|---------|----------------|
| `auth` | login/logout and token acquisition |
| `completion` | generate shell completion scripts |
| `schema` | inspect local command and procedure metadata |
| `doctor` | inspect build, config, API host, and auth health |
| `whoami` | verify current auth state |
| `settings` | inspect and update local CLI config |
| `search` | run search against the hosted API |
| `list-top-movies` | fetch top-movies data |
| `add-transfer` | send transfer requests |
| `user` | user-scoped API operations such as profile aliases, settings, folders, indexers, search, and transfer add namespacing |
| `version` | expose build metadata and release provenance |
| `self-update` | install a released binary over the current executable |

## Local State

```mermaid
graph TD
  CLI["command"] --> Store["config.Store"]
  Store --> File["$XDG_CONFIG_HOME/chilly/config.json or profiles/<profile>/config.json"]
```

The config store owns:

- API base URL
- auth token
- active profile selection via CLI flags and environment

The store normalizes defaults and writes atomically through a temp-file replace flow.
It also keeps the config directory private (`0700`) and the config file private (`0600`).
The historical production path stays at `.../chilly/config.json`. Named profiles live under `.../chilly/profiles/<profile>/config.json`.
Dev builds resolve to the `dev` profile automatically unless `--profile`, `CHILLY_PROFILE`, or `--config` overrides it.

## Request Flow

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
  participant User
  participant Command
  participant Store
  participant Client
  participant API

  User->>Command: chilly search ...
  Command->>Store: load config
  Store-->>Command: api_base_url, auth_token
  Command->>Client: call procedure
  Client->>API: POST /v4/{procedure}
  API-->>Client: JSON response or error envelope
  Client-->>Command: typed result / APIError
  Command-->>User: pretty or JSON output
```

## API Client Model

The current client is intentionally lightweight:

- it sends HTTP POST requests directly to `/v4/{procedure}`
- it supports `none` and `user` auth modes
- it adds `X-Request-Id` for tracing
- it parses the shared error envelope into `APIError`

This repo does not yet consume generated RPC bindings directly. It currently uses a manual procedure-oriented client.

## Introspection Model

The CLI keeps a local metadata registry for:

- public command schemas
- backend procedure schemas linked from those commands
- raw JSON request-body entrypoints for agent-facing mutating commands
- dry-run eligibility for mutating surfaces
- field-selection eligibility for read surfaces and schema views
- supported single-field patch semantics for user settings

That registry is the source of truth for:

- `chilly schema`
- `chilly <command> --describe`
- canonical-vs-alias metadata for overlapping top-level and nested commands
- raw request-body support such as `add-transfer --json @-`, `auth login --json @-`, `settings set --json @-`, and `self-update --json`
- current `--dry-run` support for mutating commands
- current `--fields` support for read commands and schema surfaces

The current milestone does not fetch schema dynamically from the API. Discovery is explicit and local to the CLI repo.

## Agent Knowledge Packaging

The repo ships one entry skill at `skills/chilly-cli` and uses nested reference docs under `skills/chilly-cli/references/` for progressive disclosure:

- `auth.md`: login, logout, `whoami`, host checks, and profile isolation
- `read.md`: read-only hosted API workflows
- `mutate.md`: side-effecting workflows with `--dry-run` and raw payload guidance
- `contracts.md`: `schema`, `--describe`, `doctor`, and local contract discovery

This keeps the top-level skill stable while letting agents load only the workflow-specific reference they need next. The same security posture applies across the skill and its references: the agent is not a trusted operator, so narrow reads, explicit schema discovery, local validation, and request previews are preferred over optimistic execution.

## Package Layout

- `cmd/chilly`: process entrypoint
- `internal/cli`: Cobra adapter layer and command orchestration
  - command files are named after the surface they expose, such as `auth.go`, `search.go`, and `user.go`
  - shared support files are named by role, such as `output_pretty.go`, `output_fields.go`, `schema_registry.go`, and `rpc_procedures.go`
  - the package stays flat on purpose so the command surface is easy to scan without introducing shallow helper subpackages
- `internal/config`: local config persistence and normalization
- `internal/rpc`: low-level API transport
- `internal/buildinfo`: version metadata injected at build time
- `internal/update`: reusable GitHub release lookup and binary replacement logic
- `scripts/`: install helpers shipped with the repo

This keeps CLI command glue separate from reusable transport and release modules so future SDK or MCP extraction does not need to unwind command-specific concerns.

## Boundaries

- Local config is the only persistent state in this repo.
- The CLI does not embed backend behavior. It delegates to the hosted API.
- Auth is bearer-token based for user-scoped commands.

## Output And Error Contract

- Successful command data is written to `stdout`.
- Prompts, warnings, and error output are written to `stderr`.
- When `stdout` is not a terminal and `--output` is not set explicitly, command data defaults to compact JSON.
- In `--output json`, failures emit a single JSON error envelope to `stderr`.
- Exit codes are classified into usage (`2`), auth (`3`), API (`4`), and internal (`5`) failures.

For supported mutating commands, `--dry-run` validates local input and writes a deterministic request or config-change preview to `stdout` without mutating local state, loading auth, or calling the API.

`add-transfer`, `auth login`, `settings set`, and `self-update` accept two request styles:

- convenience flags such as `--url`, `--token`, `--check`, or positional key/value arguments
- raw JSON request bodies with `--json`, including `--json @-` to read from stdin when a pipeline is easier than shell-escaping

`user settings set` supports two write paths:

- full JSON request bodies with `--json`, including `--json @-` to read from stdin
- one-field patch mode that fetches current settings, merges a validated patch, and saves the full object back through the existing RPC

For supported read commands, `--fields` applies a client-side field mask to the JSON response before rendering it to `stdout`. The main agent-facing read surfaces now include `search`, `whoami`, `list-top-movies`, `doctor`, `get-transfer`, `user settings get`, `user profile`, `user search`, `user top-movies`, `user transfer get`, `user indexers`, `user download-folder`, `user folder get`, `settings path`, `settings show`, `settings get`, `version`, `schema`, `schema command`, and `schema procedure`.

Search hardens opaque `--indexer-id` input before it reaches the API. It rejects control characters, traversal-like segments, percent-encoded strings, and embedded path/query/fragment characters so agent hallucinations fail locally instead of leaking into remote requests. The low-level RPC client applies the same class of checks to procedure names before building `/v4/{procedure}` URLs, and `settings set api-base-url` rejects user info, query strings, fragments, and non-root paths.

In default pretty mode, the core read commands render small human-oriented summaries while `--output json` keeps the machine contract stable.

`doctor` is a read-only diagnostic surface. It reports the active profile, resolved config path, API base URL, build metadata, and auth health. In online mode it verifies the saved token with the user profile RPC; `--offline` limits the report to local state.

## Guardrails And Release Flow

- Local hooks live in `.githooks/`
- Shared quality tasks live in `mise.toml`
- CI runs `mise run verify`
- Pushes to `main` run the release workflow
- semantic-release decides the next version and tag
- the same workflow runs GoReleaser to publish GitHub release artifacts and update the Homebrew tap

## Browser Auth Flow

Interactive login is CLI-native rather than web-app mediated:

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
  participant User
  participant CLI
  participant Browser
  participant API
  participant Putio

  CLI->>CLI: start loopback callback server
  CLI->>Browser: open /auth/putio/start?success_url=http://127.0.0.1:port/...
  Browser->>API: GET /auth/putio/start
  API->>Putio: redirect to provider auth
  Putio->>API: oauth callback
  API->>Browser: redirect with #auth_token=...
  Browser->>CLI: POST auth_token to loopback callback server
  CLI->>API: verify token via user profile RPC
  CLI->>CLI: persist auth token in config store
```

The CLI talks directly to the API for both token verification and all user-scoped RPCs. The browser is only used to complete the put.io OAuth step and hand the resulting token back to the local loopback server.
